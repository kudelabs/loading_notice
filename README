LoadingNotice
=============

Loading Notice is a plugin, built on Prototype, which shows an indictor when a slow AJAX is under process automatically. Basically, it's like the "Loading" div appears in gmail when busy. And when the users scroll or resize the window, it will still keep showing on the top of the page.
 
 
 
HOWTO
=====
 
1. Install the plugin:
    copy loading-notice.js to your javascript directly
    
    TODO: make it as a real rails plugin
    
2. Include the library into your project:
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'prototype', 'loading-notice' %>
 
3. Add a "loading" div and initialize a javascript object:
    <div id="loading" style="display: none">Loading...</div>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
      window.onload = function() {
        window.loading_notice = new LoadingNotice("loading");
      }
    </script>
    
    TODO: dynamic insert the loading div through javascript
    
    
4. That's all!
